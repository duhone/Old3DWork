 To submit your contest entry, please follow the instructions below:

 Your entry must be submitted in the form of two zip files.  One zip file will
 contain only the binaries and data files neccesary to actually run your demo.
 The other zip file will contain only the source code to your entry. 

 Please name your zip files clearly, to indicate which file is which.  The
 recommended approach is to name your files like this:
 
 FullName-bin.zip  (Binaries zip file)
 FullName-src.zip  (Source code zip file)

 Where FullName is your name.
 
 Once you've created your zip files, please make sure they're under the size limit
 outlined in the terms and conditions for the contest.  When you're ready to submit
 them, simply e-mail the files to contest@shadertech.com.  Please include this
 submission form with your e-mail as well!!!  Please also be sure you've included
 the required license.txt file in the relevant zip files, as outlined in the contest
 terms and conditions.

 Within 48 hours of receiving your entry, we will reply with a confirmation e-mail
 that it was received.  If you do not hear from us within this time frame, please
 write to us again.

 If you have any questions about submitting entries, simply e-mail us.  We
 recommend that you submit your demo a few days before the deadline so as to give us
 time to let you know of any difficulties that may have come up when trying
 to run your entry.

 Before submitting your files, be sure you've read and agree to the
 official terms and conditions found here:
